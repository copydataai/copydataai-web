##  Reaching action
>  The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way. by Marcus Aurelius


Fearfulness, forgiveness, and kindness are commonly reached by our actions in different decisions/actions we make.

But those who don't reach action are declared dead by themselves. A simple decision as what do I wear? could convert or worse make a butterfly effect in your day(just analogy).
